Stakeholders
------------
Identify as _comprehensive_ a list of stakeholders as possible for Open Project.  
Include a brief explanatory description for each.


Functional Requirements
-----------------------
Identify 5 functional (feature) requirements for Open Project.  
Include a brief explanatory description for each.

For each requirement, ask yourself the question: are they atomic ?  
(can they be broken down into a number of simpler requirements)


Non-functional Requirements
-----------------------
Identify 5 non-functional requirements that constrain the operation of Open Project.

Be sure to think broadly about the different types of constraint.  
Don't just repeat similar ones for different aspects of the system.

For each requirement, ask yourself the question: are they verifiable ?  
(can we check conclusively that each requirement has been fulfilled).
